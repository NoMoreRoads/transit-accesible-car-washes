# transit-accesible-car-washes
Author: [Zach Lesher](https://github.com/NoMoreRoads)

What are the most transit-accessible car washes in the Portland, OR area?

The goal of this analysis is to identify the most transit-acessible car washes, car repair shops, and gas stations in the Portland area.

I will use data sources that will enable this analysis to easily be replicated in other US cities and towns.

This is a slightly tounge-in-cheek way to draw attention to questionable land uses in cities with decent transit networks. 
(i.e. what good is it to be able to ride a train to a gas station? What other types of uses could that property be that would provide more social value?)
